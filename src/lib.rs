//!
//! `unimock` is a library that makes it easy to create mock objects that implement _multiple traits_ at the same time.
//!
//! unimock exports a single type, [Unimock], that will implement all your annotated traits:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(generic_associated_types)]
//! use unimock::*;
//! #[unimock_next]
//! trait Foo {
//!     fn foo(&self) -> i32;
//! }
//!
//! #[unimock_next]
//! trait Bar {
//!     fn bar(&self) -> i32;
//! }
//!
//! fn sum(foobar: impl Foo + Bar) -> i32 {
//!     foobar.foo() + foobar.bar()
//! }
//!
//! /*
//! fn test() {
//!     let unimock = Unimock::new()
//!         .mock(|foo: &mut MockFoo| {
//!             foo.expect_foo().return_const(40);
//!         })
//!         .mock(|bar: &mut MockBar| {
//!             bar.expect_bar().return_const(2);
//!         });
//!
//!     let answer = sum(unimock);
//!     assert_eq!(42, answer);
//! }
//! */
//!
//! fn test_next() {
//!     assert_eq!(
//!         42,
//!         sum(
//!             mock(Foo__foo, |each| {
//!                 each.call(matching!()).returns(40);
//!             })
//!             .also_mock(Bar__bar, |each| {
//!                 each.call(matching!()).returns(2);
//!             })
//!         )
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `unimock` uses [`mockall`] to mock single traits, which is where the `MockFoo` and `MockBar` types above come from.
//!
//! [`mockall`]: https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/
//!
//! `unimock` also works with `async_trait`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #![feature(generic_associated_types)]
//! use unimock::*;
//! use async_trait::*;
//! #[unimock_next]
//! #[async_trait]
//! trait Baz {
//!     async fn baz(&self, arg: String) -> i32;
//! }
//! ```

/// Autogenerate mocks for all methods in the annotated traits, and `impl` it for [Unimock].
///
/// Mock generation happens by declaring a new [Mock]-implementing struct for each method.
///
/// Example
/// ```rust
/// #![feature(generic_associated_types)]
/// use unimock::*;
///
/// #[unimock_next]
/// trait Trait1 {
///     fn a(&self) -> i32;
///     fn b(&self) -> i32;
/// }
///
/// #[unimock_next]
/// trait Trait2 {
///     fn c(&self) -> i32;
/// }
///
/// fn sum(obj: impl Trait1 + Trait2) -> i32 {
///     obj.a() + obj.b() + obj.c()
/// }
///
/// fn test() {
///     let single_mock: Unimock = mock(Trait1__a, |_| {});
///     sum(single_mock); // note: panics at runtime!
/// }
/// ```
pub use unimock_macros::unimock_next;

///
/// Macro to ease argument pattern matching.
/// This macro produces a closure expression suitable for passing to [builders::Each::call].
///
/// Takes inspiration from [std::matches] and works similarly, except that the value to match
/// can be removed as a macro argument, since it is instead received as the closure argument.
///
/// Unimock uses tuples to represent multiple arguments. A single argument is not a tuple.
/// To avoid the extra set of parentheses for simple multi-argument matchers, there is
/// a special syntax that accepts several top-level patterns:
/// `matching!("a", "b")` will expand to `matching!(("a", "b"))`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use unimock::*;
///
/// fn one_str() {
///     fn args(_: impl Fn(&(&str)) -> bool) {}
///     args(matching!("a"));
/// }
///
/// fn three_strs() {
///     fn args(_: impl Fn(&(&str, &str, &str)) -> bool) {}
///     args(matching!("a", _, "c"));
///     args(matching!(("a", "b", "c") | ("d", "e", "f")));
///     args(matching!(("a", b, "c") if b.contains("foo")));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Auto-"coercions"
///
/// Since the input expression being matched is generated by the macro, you would
/// normally suffer from the following problem when matching some non-`&str` function input:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// # fn test() -> bool {
/// let string = String::new();
/// match &string {
///     "foo" => true, // expected struct `String`, found `str`
///     _ => false,
/// # }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To help ergonomics, the `matching` macro recognizes certain literals used in the
/// patterns, and performs appropriate type conversion at the correct places:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use unimock::*;
/// struct Newtype(String);
///
/// fn exotic_strings() {
///     fn args(_: impl Fn(&(String, std::borrow::Cow<'static, str>, Newtype, i32)) -> bool) {}
///     args(matching!(("a", _, "c", _) | (_, "b", _, 42)));
/// }
///
/// // Newtype works by implementing the following:
/// impl std::convert::AsRef<str> for Newtype {
///     fn as_ref(&self) -> &str {
///         self.0.as_str()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Internally it works by calling [as_str_ref] on inputs matched by a string literal.
